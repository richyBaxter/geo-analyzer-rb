### Option 2: Manual Setup

**[See detailed manual setup guide below ↓](#installation)**

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Cloudflare Account** - Free tier is sufficient ([Sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up))
- ✅ **Claude Desktop** - With MCP support ([Download](https://claude.ai/download))
- ✅ **Node.js 20+** - For local development ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- 🎯 **Jina AI API Key** - Highly recommended for production use ([Get free key](https://jina.ai/))

### About Jina.ai Integration

**Why Jina.ai?** The Reader API transforms messy web pages into clean, AI-ready markdown—removing ads, navigation, footers, and clutter. This dramatically improves analysis accuracy.

**Free Tier Benefits:**
- 1M tokens per month (roughly 250 page analyses per day)
- Clean markdown output optimized for LLM processing  
- Automatic image caption extraction
- Link summary generation
- Works with any publicly accessible URL

**Without Jina:** Analysis still functions but uses basic content extraction. For production use and best results, the Jina API key is strongly recommended.

## 🎯 What is GEO?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing content to appear in AI-generated responses from systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity and other LLM-based search engines.

### Key Metrics Analyzed

| Metric | Target | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Claim Density** | 4.0+ claims per 100 words | Factual statements AI can extract and cite |
| **Sentence Length** | ~20 words average | Optimal length for AI parsing |
| **Semantic Triples** | High density | Subject-predicate-object relationships |
| **Entity Diversity** | Multiple types | Breadth of named entities (PERSON, ORG, PRODUCT) |
| **Date Markers** | Present | Temporal context for freshness signals |

### The Research Behind GEO

This tool implements methodologies from **"GEO: Generative Engine Optimization"** by Aggarwal et al., published at ACM SIGKDD 2024 ([read the full paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09735)). The research analyzed 10,000 diverse queries across multiple AI systems to identify which content optimization techniques most effectively improve visibility in AI-generated responses.

**Core Principles from the Research:**

**Extractability**: How easily AI systems can extract discrete facts and claims from content. The study found that content with higher claim density (4+ claims per 100 words) and optimal sentence length (15-20 words) performed significantly better.

**Citability**: How quotable and attributable the content is through semantic triples and entity relationships. Pages with rich entity diversity and clear subject-predicate-object relationships were 40% more likely to be cited by AI systems.

**Readability**: How well-structured the content is for AI parsing through clear headings, lists, and logical chunking. Hierarchical structure improved AI comprehension and extraction accuracy.

**Key Finding**: The research evaluated 9 optimization methods and found that traditional SEO approaches like keyword stuffing performed poorly (often reducing visibility). Instead, methods focused on **extractability** (claim density, semantic triples, entity extraction) delivered the strongest improvements—increasing AI citation rates by up to 40% compared to baseline content.

### About This Implementation

This MCP server provides **methodology-based analysis**, not performance predictions. We measure factors the research identified as important for AI citability, helping you optimize content according to proven principles.

**Important**: Results show what the analysis found, not guarantees about AI system behaviour. Use this as a guide for content optimization, not a prediction tool.

## 🏛️ Why Self-Hosted?

This tool requires you to deploy your own Cloudflare Worker. There is no public API endpoint.

### Why This Approach?

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| ✅ **Privacy** | Your analysis requests go through your own Worker |
| ✅ **No Shared Costs** | Each user pays for their own usage (free tier sufficient) |
| ✅ **Scalability** | No central bottleneck as the project grows |
| ✅ **Security** | No shared credentials or authentication complexity |
| ✅ **Control** | You control rate limits and usage |

### Your Data

- **No Storage**: Content is analyzed in real-time, nothing is persisted
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or usage tracking
- **Your Infrastructure**: Runs on your Cloudflare account
- **Your Logs**: Only you can access Worker logs and metrics

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ❌ "Worker deployment failed"

**Symptoms:** Error during `wrangler deploy`

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're logged in: `npx wrangler login`
2. Check Cloudflare account is active and verified
3. Verify Node.js version: `node --version` (should be 20+)
4. Check for typos in `wrangler.toml`
5. Try deploying again - Cloudflare may be provisioning resources

#### ❌ "MCP server not connecting"

**Symptoms:** Tools don't appear in Claude Desktop

**Solutions:**
1. **Restart Claude Desktop completely** (close all windows)
2. Check config file location:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Verify JSON syntax is valid (use [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/))
4. Check `GEO_WORKER_URL` has no trailing slash
5. Ensure Worker URL is accessible (open in browser - should show `{"error":"Not found"}`)
6. Look for errors in Claude Desktop logs

#### ❌ "API error: 401"

**Symptoms:** Analysis fails with authentication error

**Solutions:**
1. Check `JINA_API_KEY` is correctly set in Claude config
2. Verify API key at [Jina AI dashboard](https://jina.ai/)
3. Ensure no extra spaces or quotes in API key
4. Try without Jina API key (analysis will use basic extraction)

#### ❌ "Analysis timing out"

**Symptoms:** Long wait times or timeout errors

**Solutions:**
1. Check page is publicly accessible (not behind login/paywall)
2. Try a smaller/simpler page first
3. Verify Cloudflare Workers AI is enabled in your account
4. Check Cloudflare dashboard for any service issues
5. Consider the page size - very large pages may take longer

#### ❌ "Content exceeds maximum size"

**Symptoms:** Error about 1MB limit

**Solutions:**
1. This only affects the `validate_rewrite` tool
2. Content must be under 1MB (roughly 250,000 words)
3. For normal URL analysis, there's no size limit
4. Try analyzing the original URL instead

#### ❌ "Invalid Worker URL"

**Symptoms:** MCP server fails to start

**Solutions:**
1. URL must include `https://` protocol
2. URL must be a `.workers.dev` domain or custom domain
3. No trailing slashes
4. Copy exactly from Wrangler deployment output

### Getting Help

If you're stuck:

1. **Check Worker logs**: `npx wrangler tail` in worker directory
2. **Test Worker directly**: Visit Worker URL in browser
3. **Verify MCP connection**: Look for "Connected" status in Claude
4. **Review security audit**: See `SECURITY-AUDIT.md` for security best practices
